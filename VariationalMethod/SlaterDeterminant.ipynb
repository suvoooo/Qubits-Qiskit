The Hartree principle is to approximate the wave function of a many-particle system by taking products of single-particle wave functions. Electrons (fermions) are indistinguishable and a wave function representing a system of electrons must be anti-symmetric (Pauli's exclusion principle) under the exchange of any two fermions. Anti-symmetric wave functions can be represented as:\n","\n","$$|\\psi⟩(x_1, x_2) = - |\\psi⟩(x_2, x_1)$$\n","\n","This doesn't hold for Hartree product. As electrons are indistinguishable one natural thing to do is to construct another wavefunction by taking a linear superposition as below:\n","\n","$$\\begin{align} |\\psi⟩(x_1, x_2) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|\\phi\\rangle_1 (x_1)\\, |\\phi\\rangle_2 (x_2)\\, - |\\phi\\rangle_1 (x_2)\\, |\\phi\\rangle_2 (x_1)\\,) \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{vmatrix} |\\phi\\rangle_1 (x_1) && |\\phi\\rangle_2 (x_1)\\\\ |\\phi\\rangle_1 (x_2) && |\\phi\\rangle_2 (x_2)\\,    \\end{vmatrix} \\end{align}\\, \\ldots \\, (19)$$\n","\n","Here we can easily verify that $|\\psi⟩(x_1, x_2) = - |\\psi⟩(x_2, x_1)$.\n","\n","If there happen to be two identical rows or two identical columns, it means that two particles share the same spatial coordinates (and spin); the determinant then equals zero, meaning that such situation is physically impossible (Pauli Exclusion principle). One can also see that the Slater determinant is anti-symmetric upon the exchange of any two electrons. We recall that if we take a matrix and interchange two of its rows, the determinant changes sign.\n","\n","We usually call these $|\\phi ⟩$'s as spin orbitals. It takes both the position and spin angular momentum of the particle,  so $x_i$ is actually $ (x_i, y_i, z_i, s_{z_i})$. Each column includes a different spin orbital as a function of the coordinates $(x_i)$ in each row. So, it is never possible to say that $|\\phi ⟩_1$ describes the first electron and $|\\phi ⟩_2$ the second electron. The terms first electron and second electron have no meaning as the electrons are indistinguishable and it is never possible to put a label on one specific electron. That's why the linear combination of them works and in the linear combination itself we see that for two electrons $|\\phi ⟩_i$ appear twice.   \n","\n","**Note: If we do change the -'ve' sin to +'ve' we get a linear superposition that will not vanish for identical particles, these are called Bosons**     \n","\n","We can simply expand the Slater determinant for multi-particle case by expanding the determinant as below:\n","\n","$$\\psi (x_1, x_2, \\ldots x_N) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}} \\begin{vmatrix} |\\phi\\rangle_1 (x_1) && |\\phi\\rangle_2 (x_1) && \\ldots && |\\phi\\rangle_N (x_1) \\\\ |\\phi\\rangle_1 (x_2) && |\\phi\\rangle_2 (x_2) && \\ldots && |\\phi\\rangle_N (x_2) \\\\ \\vdots && \\vdots && \\ddots && \\vdots \\\\ |\\phi\\rangle_1 (x_N) && |\\phi\\rangle_2 (x_N) && \\ldots && |\\phi\\rangle_N (x_N) \\end{vmatrix} \\equiv |\\phi_1, \\phi _2, \\ldots, \\phi _N\\rangle \\, \\ldots \\, (20)$$\n","\n","--------------------------------------------------------\n","\n","#### Second Quantization\n","\n","\n","Once we have this multi-particle wave-function, we will move to the basics of Second Quantization, which provides the framework for the formulation of many-body quantum systems."],"metadata":{"id":"NJLcn7pSL2MM"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### References\n","\n","[1] ['Intro to HF Molecular Orbital Theory'](http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/notes/hf-intro/hf-intro.pdf); D.
